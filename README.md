This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project description

“What to Eat?” is a web application that allows users to swipe and choose among a variety of random recipes. The goal is to help people find good recipes for daily cooking. Another value is to create an online community where home cooks enjoy watching, sharing and interacting with recipes.

The swiping feature, resembling that of Tinder, makes it easier, quicker and more fun to search for a recipe. Users can surf through each card of recipe and select their favorite ones. Swiping right means liking the recipe, which will be saved in "Saved recipes". Swiping left means disliking the recipe, which will disappear from the deck for a while. There are several filters included to fit every one's preferences. Users are also able to like, save, share and add their own recipes.

## Next version

Further development includes more elaborated functions for recipes filter, account sign in/sign up, and better design for recipes viewer page.

- Recipe filter results should trigger a behavior from the swiping cards to automatically sort out and keep only recipes that meet the criteria.
- Users are able to either create an account or log in/out as in a normal website.
- After clicking on whether a card or a recipe thumbnail, users will be directed to a more well-structured view of the recipe.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
